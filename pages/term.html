		<h2>Terminological Database</h2>
		<p>(Not online accessible yet)</p>
		<p>The terminological data collected in WSC contains a sample set of Chinese scientific terms coined in the time
			of the late Chinese empire. The data is based on specialized and general dictionaries published between 1815 and
			1916.</p>
		<p>The reconstruction of scientific terminologies that have evolved from the complex process of translation, has
			to rely on the systematic examination of extensive source materials from different genres.</p>
		<p>The terminological sample currently includes entries on approx. 127,000 simple and compound terms.</p>

		<h2>Biographical Database</h2>
		<p>(Not online accessible yet)</p>
		<p>The biographical database stores biographical information on the authors and translators. It carefully keeps
			track of the translated names in Western and Asian script, as well as of Chinese and Japanese pen names, so that
			authors and translators may be clearly identified in the complex process of translation. In addition, links to
			further info in biographical dictionaries are provided.</p>
		<p>The biographical database currently holds data on more than 5,000 persons.</p>
